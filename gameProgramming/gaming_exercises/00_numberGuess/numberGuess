# Player needs to guess a number.
# Select the secret number from a given range.

   # Tell them it's wrong.

   # Tell them if it's too high/low
# What if they guess right?

   # Award a point.
# What happens if they run out of guesses?
   # Display you lose.
   # Reward point to CPU
# Check to see if player or CPU has >= 3 points, if so they win.
