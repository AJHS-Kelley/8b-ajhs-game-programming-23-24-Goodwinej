# Player needs to guess a number.
# Select the secret number from a given range.
# Compare guess to the secret number.
# What happens if they guess wrong?
   # Tell them it's wrong.
   # Tell them how many guesses are left.
   # Tell them if it's too high/low
# What if they guess right?
   # Tell them the guess is correct.
   # Award a point.
# What happens if they run out of guesses?
   # Display you lose.
   # Reward point to CPU
# Check to see if player or CPU has >= 3 points, if so they win.
